## 🚀 Features

* **Unified Data Access:** Offers a single endpoint for querying and mutating data across the VitalLink ecosystem.
* **Real-Time Synchronization:** Ensures consistent and up-to-date information across web and mobile platforms.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Built with TypeScript and Prisma for type safety and scalability.
* **Secure Operations:** Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive health data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **GraphQL:** For defining the API schema and handling client-server interactions.
* **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and robust code structure.
* **Prisma:** An ORM for database management and migrations.
* **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
